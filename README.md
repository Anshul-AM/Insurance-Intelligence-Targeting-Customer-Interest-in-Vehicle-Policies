## Introduction

Our client, a leading insurance company, is expanding from health insurance into vehicle insurance. To support this new initiative, the company aims to predict which of its current policyholders are likely to purchase vehicle insurance.

By leveraging machine learning and advanced data analysis techniques, this project helps optimize cross-selling strategies and enhance marketing efforts. It offers insights into customer behavior and helps estimate the probability of customer interest in purchasing vehicle insurance, streamlining business operations and improving profitability.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Gradio, Hugging Face Spaces

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user provides demographic details, vehicle information, and policy specifics.
2. **Prediction**: The machine learning model predicts the likelihood of customer interest in vehicle insurance.
3. **Output**: The result is a percentage that represents the predicted interest level of the customer in purchasing vehicle insurance.
